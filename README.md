# Supersonic_Airquality

This repository contains code and processed data used in the manuscript on Mechanisms Driving Altitude- and Latitude-Dependent Air Quality Variations from High-Altitude NOx Emissions

## Repository Structure

### Code.GCC_SAi20/
GEOS-Chem model code used to perform the simulations in this study.

### RefDir/
Reference directories and configuration templates used to define simulation settings.

### gen_dir.py
Python script to generate simulation directories with user-defined model settings based on `RefDir`.

### Figure_gen_code/
Python scripts used to generate all figures presented in the manuscript.

### Data/
Processed datasets required to reproduce manuscript figures and reported values.

## Notes
- This repository provides analysis-ready outputs and figure-generation scripts.
- Raw model outputs are not included due to data volume constraints.
